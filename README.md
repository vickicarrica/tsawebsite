The code for the website created for the TSA Webmasters challenge

All code made by Vicki Carrica, 04/11/2021 (and some stolen from stack overflow, ofc)

This code was created for the purpose of participating in a website making contest. Description of contest is as follows:

Event Description:  Participants (three teams of three to six [3-6] individuals per chapter; one entry per team) design, build, and launch a website that features the team's ability to incorporate the elements of website design, graphic layout, and proper coding techniques. 

 2021 Theme: Medical On Demand

Context: Due to recent global events, consumers and the healthcare industry were forced to change their medical screening practices. Virtual appointments via mobile interfacing and webcam communications have been used for patients that were unable to or restricted from physically seeing a doctor.

Challenge:  Create a fictional medical telecommunications company and design a website. The website should serve as a guide for information about the company and their communication services provided. Present an overview of services as if you were a consumer. Provide the type of solutions your company creates, sells, and/or serves. Sections of the site may include photos, product descriptions, renderings, company history, contact, and news updates.


3 HTML files:
1) page.html is the main website (smooth scroll)
2) schedule.html is the page that contains the scheduling form
3) results.html is the page that has the form results
1 CSS file: just for styling
1 JS file: smooth scroll effects, drop down interaction, and such


Not my best work but considering that it was done in less than 36 hrs I can't complain. :) feel free to use any part of my code (disclaimer that some of the js is not very good at all), but credits would be very appreciated!
